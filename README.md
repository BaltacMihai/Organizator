Did you happen to have a full desktop?

My project is to solve the problem of a full desktop and not finding files.

The program creates a hierarchical structure of folders that can be placed in any partition, including external memory (CD, Stick).

But now another problem arises:

How will I be able to navigate from one place to another?

The program generates a web page both in the root folder and on the desktop. This page was designed to help the user navigate folders more easily. Because there are people who move their desktop to another partition, the program asked you this detail.
